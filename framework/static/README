This folder should contain the static content of the application,
i.e css, javascript, images, downloadable contents which are
fully static (no generated content, no access control).
You should put content that needs access control (e.g profile images,
confidential downlodable files, etc.) in another folder and
use DownloadManager class to serve them after access control.
