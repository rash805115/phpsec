Placeholder for view files of your MVC application.
Keep in mind that in MVC, view files should have minimal logic.

The only accepted php code for view files are:
1. Dumping variables
2. Conditional statements with no function calls in conditions
3. Loops to dump arrays and objects
4. Generating Pull MVC widgets using variables (usually constructors and chaining)
5. Publishing Pull MVC widgets using publish methods

No other function calls should be in a view.
